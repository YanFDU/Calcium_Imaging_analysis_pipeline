# Calcium_Imaging_analysis_pipeline
Executable analysis pipeline for Calcium Imaging Data (Fluo_4AM; GCaMP;)
This pipeline provides a standalone executable tool for analyzing calcium imaging data from experiments using Fluo-4AM, GCaMP, or similar calcium indicators. It is optimized for use with Suite2p outputs and includes automated steps for trace processing, spike detection, and ROI-based statistics.

Recommended Workflow
1. Run "Bleach_correction.exe"
2. Run "Suite2P_PyQt5_GUI.exe"
3. MatLab plots （copy this folder to "C:\ ", scripts will be automatically copied to your new folder that you set up in step 2. Use MatLab to open the folder and run the scripts.）


This tool is provided for research use.
